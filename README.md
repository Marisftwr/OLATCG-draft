# olatcg-frontend 🧬

OLATCG is an easy-to-use bioinformatics interface for students from all over the world. 🌎 

## Descrition 📃

Focused on high school and earlier graduation, the platform makes it possible to perform different types of Bioinformatics analysis through pre-established pipelines. Besides it, OLATCG has a **_learn_** section that attempts not only to demonstrate how to use the available **_tools_**, but understand what's behind it's implementation. All available tool uses accurate computatinal models widely disseminated in the scientific academy.

## What can I do with OLATCG? 🤔

Actually, besides the tutorials and explanations present in learn section, we have some features that the actual tools allows us to do. With OLATCG's tools you can

- Align two sequences
  - Globally
  - Locally

- Perform phylogenetic study of multiple sequences getting informations (based on serach against OLATCG's database) like
  - Taxonomy
  - Identity
  - Alignments
  - Country Origin
  - Correponding sequence in GenBank
  
- Generate a simple phylogenetic tree to your homology study

- Use BLASTN (in progress)

## Actual Deploy ☁

Actually, we are passing through a repository update process. So, our deploy still based on our legacy initial project (https://github.com/LuizMVB/olatcg). Ropefully, we'll going to change it as sooner as possible.

But, this is a good way to know more about olatcg's world and purpose.
